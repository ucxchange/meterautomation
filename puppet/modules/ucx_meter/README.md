## Overview

The ucx-meter module installs the UCX WAC Meter.

## Usage

You can configure all options in the main class.

## Development

UCX Meter modules on  the  Puppet  Forge are  open  projects, and  community
contributions are  essential for keeping  them great.  We canâ€™t access  the huge
number  of   platforms  and  myriad   of  hardware,  software,   and  deployment
configurations that  Puppet is intended to  serve so feel free  to contribute on
GitHub.
